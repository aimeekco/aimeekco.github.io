    longdescription: 'P-Geolocation is a web app that returns a user\'s location on Google Maps given two timestamped images of the sun. The app uses computer vision algorithms to analyze the position of the sun in each image and calculate the user\'s latitude and longitude based on the angle of the sun. By comparing the timestamps of the images, P-Geolocation can determine the user\'s location at the time the photos were taken. This innovative technology allows users to geolocate themselves without the need for GPS or other location-based services, making it an ideal solution for remote or off-grid locations.'},
